An app has been developed to detect real-time emergencies on Twitter using a fine-tuned Transformer model. The process involved data preprocessing, model training with TensorFlow, and deployment on Huggingface. Notable achievements include the use of the "dimbat_disaster_distilbert" model for improved accuracy and the creation of an intuitive interface, all developed in Visual Studio Code.

The machine learning model predicts whether tweets are related to real disasters or not.
